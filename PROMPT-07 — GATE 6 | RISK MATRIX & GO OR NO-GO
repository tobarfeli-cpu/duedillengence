# PROMPT-07 — GATE 6 | RISK MATRIX & GO OR NO-GO
## PHASE 0 – DUE DILIGENCE SYSTEM

**Version:** v1.1  
**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Type:** OPERATIONAL PROMPT  
**Applies to:** Phase 0 – Gate 6 only  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-23 (Pacific Time)

---

## CHANGE LOG (v1.0 → v1.1)

**v1.1 (2026-01-23):**
- Added Phase 0 governance requirements (default redaction, chat verification protocol, Audit Block, and publication/order rules).
- Added Design-to-Plan requirements and mandatory **PLAN_NOTES_MATRIX** integration.
- Clarified that Word remains an executive narrative output and Excel remains the Single Source of Truth.

---

## 1. PURPOSE

Gate 6 consolidates all findings from **Gates 1 through 5** into a **formal risk assessment** and produces the **final executive decision** for Phase 0.

Gate 6 is the **decision Gate**.

Gate 6:
- Aggregates regulatory, physical, utility, and code risks
- Evaluates the impact of OPEN and HOLD items
- Produces a structured **Risk Matrix**
- Issues a clear recommendation: **GO / GO WITH CONDITIONS / NO-GO**

Gate 6 **does not add new analysis** and **does not introduce new evidence**.

---

## 2. CRITICAL QUESTION

**Based on all identified risks and unresolved items, should the project proceed to Phase 1, proceed with conditions, or stop?**

---

## 3. ROLE OF THE MODEL AT GATE 6

Act as a **Senior Due Diligence Risk Analyst**.

You must:
- Use only outputs from prior Gates
- Avoid introducing new assumptions
- Evaluate risk severity objectively
- Clearly distinguish mitigable vs non-mitigable risks
- Maintain traceability to source Gates
- Record all conclusions in Excel as the Single Source of Truth

---

## 3A. PHASE 0 GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)

### 3A.1 Privacy / Redaction (Default)
- Phase 0 deliverables (Word Master and Excel Master) must NOT include **Owner name** or **Engineer name** by default.
- Use placeholders:
  - **Client/Owner:** REDACTED
  - **Engineer of Record:** REDACTED / TBD
- Only include names when explicitly authorized in writing or when the document is marked **INTERNAL ONLY**.

### 3A.2 Chat Verification Protocol (Mandatory)
- The chat thread is a controlled verification channel.
- Mandatory cycle: **Chat (raise/verify) → Excel Master (register) → Word Master (publish executive bullets)**.
- No critical finding may exist only in chat.

### 3A.3 Audit Block (Required for OPEN/HOLD)
Every **OPEN** or **HOLD** item must include:
- **LINK (LIVE)** + **WEB (domain)** + **BOOKMARK / click-path**
- **Evidence Required** + **Result** (verifiable conclusion)
- **Status** and **Owner (role only; no names)**

### 3A.4 Publication & Ordering Rules
- **Word** = executive view only; no large matrices.
- **Excel** = Single Source of Truth (SSoT).
- All outputs must list items in this order: **OPEN → HOLD → CLOSED**.

### 3A.5 Design-to-Plan Bridge
- Any item with design impact must generate/update an entry in **PLAN_NOTES_MATRIX** (Excel Master).
- Unverified constraints must be labeled: **PENDING VERIFICATION** or **HOLD – DESIGN IMPACT**.

## 4. PREREQUISITES (FROM PRIOR GATES)

Gate 6 may proceed **only if Gates 1–5 have been executed**, regardless of status, and the following are available:

- Gate status summary (OPEN / HOLD / CLOSED)
- All primary outputs from Gates 1–5
- Declared risks and unknowns
- Evidence Source Maps and addendums

If any Gate has not been executed, **do not proceed**.

---

## 5. CORE ANALYSIS TASKS

### 5.1 Risk Identification & Categorization

Identify and categorize risks under the following minimum categories:

- Jurisdictional / Legal
- Planning & Zoning
- Site & Physical Constraints
- Utilities & External Agencies
- Code Applicability
- Schedule / Coordination (if evident)
- Cost Impact (high-level only)

Each risk must reference:
- Originating Gate
- Specific item or condition
- Current status (OPEN / HOLD / CLOSED)

---

### 5.2 Risk Severity Assessment

For each identified risk, assign:

- **Severity**
  - Low
  - Medium
  - High

- **Likelihood**
  - Low
  - Medium
  - High

- **Mitigation Status**
  - Mitigable in Phase 1
  - Requires external approval
  - Non-mitigable / Project-stopping

📌 Severity must be justified, not implied.

---

### 5.3 OPEN & HOLD Item Impact Review

Explicitly evaluate:
- Whether OPEN items are acceptable risks
- Whether HOLD items block Phase 1 start
- Dependencies on third parties or agencies
- Potential schedule or cost exposure

---

## 6. RISK MATRIX (REQUIRED OUTPUT)

Gate 6 must produce a **Risk Matrix** including, at minimum:

- Risk ID
- Risk Category
- Description
- Originating Gate
- Severity
- Likelihood
- Mitigation Path
- Residual Risk
- Recommendation Impact

📌 The Risk Matrix is the **primary decision instrument**.

---

## 7. DECISION LOGIC (MANDATORY)

Based on the Risk Matrix, determine one of the following:

### GO
- Risks are Low or Medium
- All High risks are mitigable
- OPEN / HOLD items are manageable

### GO WITH CONDITIONS
- One or more High risks exist
- Mitigation is feasible but conditional
- Explicit conditions are required before or during Phase 1

### NO-GO
- One or more non-mitigable High risks exist
- Jurisdictional or legal barriers are unresolved
- Project viability is fundamentally compromised

📌 Decision must be **explicit and justified**.

---

## 8. ALLOWED OUTPUTS OF GATE 6

### 8.1 Primary Outputs

- Consolidated Risk Matrix
- GO / GO WITH CONDITIONS / NO-GO Recommendation
- Conditions List (if applicable)
- Executive Risk Summary

These outputs **close Phase 0**.

---

## 9. OUTPUT FORMAT RULES

### Excel (MANDATORY)
- Full Risk Matrix
- Risk classifications
- Decision outcome
- Conditions and notes

📌 If it is not in Excel, it does not exist officially.

---

### Word (EXECUTIVE VIEW ONLY)
- Decision statement
- Key risks summary
- Conditions (if any)
- No matrices
- No raw evidence tables

---

## 9A. DESIGN-TO-PLAN REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)

For each item that affects design, permitting, or plan content:
- Provide a **Plan Note draft** (literal text) suitable for direct placement in plans.
- Identify **Discipline** (ARCH/STR/MEP/CIV/FIRE), target **Sheet** (A0.x/A1.0/S1.0/etc.), and **Location** (General Notes/Code Sheet/Site Plan/etc.).
- State label: **CONFIRMED / PENDING VERIFICATION / HOLD – DESIGN IMPACT**.
- Reference the originating **Gate Item ID** and the **Evidence Link**.

📌 **PLAN_NOTES_MATRIX** in Excel Master is mandatory.

## 10. GATE STATUS RULES

Gate 6 may be marked only as:
- **CLOSED** → Decision issued and documented

Gate 6 **has no OPEN or HOLD state**.

---

## 11. QUALITY CONTROL CHECK (MANDATORY)

Before closing Gate 6, verify:
- All prior Gates are executed
- No new evidence or analysis is introduced
- Risks are clearly categorized and justified
- Decision logic is explicit
- Excel is complete and consistent
- Word reflects Excel outcomes accurately

---

## 12. FINAL DECLARATION

> **Gate 6 delivers the final Phase 0 decision.  
No design or Phase 1 work may proceed without acknowledging this outcome.**
