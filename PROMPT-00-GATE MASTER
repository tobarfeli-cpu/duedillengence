## 2. GENERAL RULES (MANDATORY)

- Excel is the Single Source of Truth (SSoT).
- Word is executive-only; no large matrices.
- Items must be ordered: OPEN → HOLD → CLOSED.
- OPEN/HOLD require Audit Block (Link/Web/Bookmark/Evidence Required/Result).
- Owner/Engineer names are redacted by default.
- If an item impacts plans, it MUST create/update PLAN_NOTES_MATRIX.

## 3. ITEM STANDARD (EXCEL — REQUIRED FIELDS)

Every Gate item must include, at minimum:
- Item_ID, Gate, Category, Status (OPEN/HOLD/CLOSED)
- Finding, Impact, Risk_Level
- Action_Required, Owner_Role, Due_Date
- LINK_LIVE, WEB_Domain, BOOKMARK_or_ClickPath
- Evidence_Required, Result_Summary, Date_Verified

---

## 4. PUBLICATION STANDARD (WORD)

Per Gate, Word Master publishes ONLY:
- Key Findings (bullets)
- OPEN items (bullets with Item_ID)
- HOLD items (bullets with Item_ID)
- CLOSED items (short bullets with Item_ID)

Evidence matrices remain exclusively in Excel Master.

---

## 5. DESIGN-TO-PLAN STANDARD (MANDATORY)

If an item affects design, permitting, or plan content:
- Create/update PLAN_NOTES_MATRIX entry with:
  - Gate_Item_ID, Discipline, Sheet, Location, Plan Note (literal), Status label, Evidence link
- If not verified, label as PENDING VERIFICATION or HOLD – DESIGN IMPACT.

---

## 6. DEFINITION OF DONE (DoD) — FOR ANY GATE

A Gate is DONE only if:
- All OPEN/HOLD items include Audit Block
- Owners are assigned (roles)
